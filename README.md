# News Recommendation at Scale: Retrieval, Behavioural Features and a Trained Re-Ranker

**CS4.406 Information Retrieval & Extraction — Assignments 1 and 2** · Chaitanya Shah

A news-recommendation pipeline over two datasets in two languages — **MIND** (Microsoft
News Dataset, English) and **EB-NeRD** (Ekstra Bladet News Recommendation Dataset,
Danish).

**Assignment 1** (frozen at tag `phase-5-complete`) built ingestion into one unified
schema, BM25 (Best Match 25) lexical retrieval, embedding-based semantic retrieval, an
offline evaluation harness with bootstrap confidence intervals, a leakage ablation, and
submissions to both Codabench leaderboards.

**Assignment 2** (this repository, tag `a2-submission-ready`) adds behavioural features
from the click-logs, a trained LambdaRank re-ranker over them, an NRMS neural baseline
with an ablated improvement and a paired bootstrap confidence interval, a serving and
scale analysis, and an extended sliced evaluation. **Design note:
[`reports/design_note_a2.pdf`](reports/design_note_a2.pdf).**

**326 tests pass**, including `tests/test_no_leakage.py`, which enforces the
behaviour-window boundary as two properties and is mutation-verified against four planted
forward leaks. Every module was mutation-tested — deliberate bugs reintroduced one at a
time to confirm the tests catch them.

Status and open items are tracked in `PROGRESS.md`; every design decision, with the
alternatives rejected, is in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (D1–D41).

## Quickstart

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt      # ~390 MB; CPU-only PyTorch, 0 CUDA packages
```

> `requirements.txt` carries `--index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` **above**
> the `torch` pin. Delete those two lines and a rebuild silently pulls **2,894 MB**
> instead, 2,238 MB of it NVIDIA packages that never load on a machine without a GPU.

### One-command rebuild (Q1.5)

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_pipeline.py
```

Reads raw-data locations from `configs/mind.yaml` and `configs/ebnerd.yaml`, verifies the
files are present, and rebuilds the whole feature store into `data/processed/`. At A2's
scale (D33: 5% of `ebnerd_large`'s users) that is **40 s at 3.3 GB peak** —
190,779 articles · 1,449,863 impressions · 268,100 user-history rows.

It does **not** download anything (D10). If raw data is missing it prints the exact
download commands and exits 1 — both the success and failure paths are tested.

## Reproducing every result

Run in this order. Timings are measured on the development machine (WSL2, 7.7 GB RAM,
**no GPU**).

| # | Command | Produces | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `scripts/build_pipeline.py` | the feature store | **2.8 s** |
| 2 | `scripts/build_embeddings.py` | `embeddings.parquet` (77,015 × 384) | **13.3 min** |
| 3 | `scripts/run_bm25_recall.py` | Q2 recall@K, both pools | **235 s** |
| 4 | `scripts/run_semantic_recall.py` | Q3 recall@K, both pools | **43 s** |
| 5 | `scripts/summarise_recall.py` | `reports/recall_summary.csv` | seconds |
| 6 | `scripts/run_rerank_eval.py` | Q4.2 AUC/MRR/nDCG, 4 scorers | **136 s** MIND, **1.2 s** EB-NeRD |
| 7 | `scripts/run_beyond_accuracy.py` | Q4.3 diversity / novelty / coverage | **283 s** |
| 8 | `scripts/run_eval_report.py` | Q4.3 slices + Q4.4 bootstrap CIs | **26 s** |
| 9 | `scripts/run_ablation.py` | Q9 serving-time ablation | **64 s** |

**Every timing above is measured on this machine** (WSL2, 7.7 GB RAM, no GPU), not
estimated. Steps 1–9 reproduce the full analysis in **under 12 minutes** end to end,
excluding the one-off 13.3 min embedding build.

Re-running steps 3–9 reproduces the committed CSVs **byte-identically** — verified, so the
pipeline is deterministic and the numbers in this README and the design note can be
regenerated rather than taken on trust.

Step 2 is deliberately **not** part of `build_pipeline.py`: that script rewrites
`articles.parquet` on every run, so vectors stored there would be recomputed each rebuild
(2.8 s → ~13 min, a 280× regression) or destroyed (D22).

### Assignment 2 (adds to the above, does not replace it)

A2's steps assume A1's store exists (steps 1–2), then add the behavioural features, the
trained re-ranker and the A2 evaluation. Timings measured on this machine
(WSL2 on aarch64, 11 GB RAM + 16 GB swap, no GPU) on 2026-09-19.

| # | Command | Produces | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `scripts/build_feature_tables.py` | cached Q1 feature tables, 6 files, 22.5M rows | **3.2 min** MIND, **10.0 min** EB-NeRD |
| A2 | `scripts/run_reranker.py` | Q2 before/after + paired CIs, model, test scores | ~3 min per dataset |
| A3 | `scripts/run_retrieved_regime.py` | Q2's retrieved-top-100 regime | ~2 min MIND, ~8 min EB-NeRD |
| A4 | `scripts/run_nrms.py` | Q3 NRMS baseline, time-term arms, ablation + paired CI | hours (CPU; see the note) |
| A5 | `scripts/run_extended_eval.py` | Q5 seven metrics × 5 slices × CIs | ~2 min MIND, ~30 min EB-NeRD |
| A6 | `scripts/run_q9_ablation.py` | Q9 with/without serving-unavailable features | ~10 min per dataset |
| A7 | `scripts/benchmark_serving.py` | Q4 footprint, per-stage p50/p99, cost per 1k queries | ~5 min per dataset |
| A8 | `scripts/run_submission_lgbm.py --dataset {mind,ebnerd}` | the A2 leaderboard files | **26 min** MIND, **155 min** EB-NeRD |
| A9 | `scripts/validate_submission.py --dataset {mind,ebnerd} --method lgbm` | pre-upload checks | ~2 min |
| A10 | `scripts/build_design_note_pdf.py` | `reports/design_note_a2.pdf` (11pt, 1in, 6-page target) | seconds |

`run_submission_lgbm.py` is **resumable**: scores are written per user-group under
`data/processed/submission/lgbm_scores_{dataset}/`, and a re-run skips finished groups.

### Tests

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest          # 326 tests, ~5 min
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/test_no_leakage.py   # the Q9 deliverable
```

## Codabench submissions (Q5)

Needs the large bundles — `MINDlarge_test` and `ebnerd_testset` — with `test_root` in each
config pointing at them.

All timings below are **measured on this machine**, not estimated.

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_submission_store.py                 # 2.3 s
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_embeddings.py \
    --datasets mind   --articles data/processed/submission/articles_mind.parquet \
    --output data/processed/submission/embeddings_mind.parquet     # 24.4 min, 82 art/s
.venv/bin/python scripts/build_embeddings.py \
    --datasets ebnerd --articles data/processed/submission/articles_ebnerd.parquet \
    --output data/processed/submission/embeddings_ebnerd.parquet   # 18.6 min, 113 art/s

# --n-recent defaults to 100 (D31); outputs are suffixed with it
.venv/bin/python scripts/run_submission.py      --dataset mind             # 4.1 min
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_submission.py --dataset mind   --suffix _n100

.venv/bin/python scripts/run_submission.py      --dataset ebnerd           # 6.3 min
.venv/bin/python scripts/validate_submission.py --dataset ebnerd --suffix _n100
```

Upload `reports/submissions/{dataset}_semantic_n100.zip`:

- MIND → https://www.codabench.org/competitions/13967/
- EB-NeRD → https://www.codabench.org/competitions/2469/

**Always run `validate_submission.py` before uploading.** A submission cannot be debugged
from a leaderboard — it returns one number and no diagnostics, so a wrong rank direction,
a dropped row and a shuffled order are indistinguishable from "the model is weak". The
validator re-reads the raw bundle and checks that line *i* carries impression *i*'s own id
and that every rank list is a permutation of 1..n against that impression's real candidate
count.

## Assignment 1 headline results (retrieval only)

Kept for continuity: these are A1's numbers, on the validation split, macro-averaged per
impression, over impressions with a usable query (D17/D18). A2's results are in the
section above and in `reports/design_note_a2.pdf`.

**Retrieval — recall@200 against a random baseline** (the baseline is what makes it
readable; without it EB-NeRD's numbers are actively misleading):

| Dataset | Pool | BM25 | Semantic | BM25 lift | Semantic lift |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MIND | whole corpus | 2.05% | **2.17%** | 6.69× | **7.08×** |
| MIND | in circulation | 3.95% | **5.41%** | 4.19× | **5.74×** |
| EB-NeRD | whole corpus | 2.45% | **2.65%** | 1.44× | **1.56×** |
| EB-NeRD | in circulation | 7.27% | **8.57%** | 1.07× | **1.26×** |

**Re-ranking the platform's own candidate list** (what both leaderboards score):

| Dataset | random | popularity | BM25 | semantic |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MIND — AUC | 0.5007 | 0.5423 | 0.5492 | **0.6338** |
| EB-NeRD — AUC | 0.4987 | 0.4647 | 0.4966 | **0.5331** |

**Tuned re-ranking (D31), and the leaderboard it produced.** The history window N was
inherited from retrieval, where D12 chose it to fight topic drift. Re-ranking has no drift
to fight, and re-tuning it was worth more than any other change:

| | val AUC | MIND leaderboard | rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| N = 10 | 0.6338 | 0.6037 | 62 / 90 |
| **N = 100** (submitted) | **0.6489** | **0.6191** | **54 / 90** |
| change | +0.0151 | **+0.0154** | +8 |

Predicted from val, delivered on the leaderboard, agreeing to **0.0003** — the offline
harness ranks design changes correctly, which is what allowed every tuning decision to be
made without spending submissions.

**EB-NeRD tests the same claim, and transfers the absolute level rather than the delta:**

| | val AUC | EB-NeRD leaderboard | rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| **N = 100** (submitted) | **0.5413** | **0.5396** | **147 / 247** |

A gap of **0.0017**, on the dataset where the same harness says the honest signal is
weakest — BM25 cannot re-rank it at all (AUC 0.4966 against a random 0.4987). Leaderboard
metrics in full: AUC 0.5396, MRR 0.3441, nDCG@5 0.3817, nDCG@10 0.4608.

Screenshots for both leaderboards are in `reports/figures/`.

**Engineering metrics** (`scripts/benchmark_engineering.py`, MIND, 65,238 articles):

| | build | size | per query p50 | p95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BM25 inverted index (D14) | 1.61 s | 19 MB | 10.10 ms | 13.47 ms |
| Embedding matrix (D21/D22) | 0.85 s load | 100 MB | **1.73 ms** | 4.51 ms |
| Re-ranking one impression | — | — | **0.01 ms** | 0.02 ms |
| `rank_bm25` — *the rejected alternative* | 0.61 s | — | **2,183.84 ms** | 13,202 ms |

Three results worth stating plainly, each of which contradicts an intuition:

- **`rank_bm25` is 216× slower per query** (30.3 h vs 8.4 min for a full val run) yet
  **builds 2.6× faster**, because it defers all work to query time. Our extra 1.00 s of
  build cost is repaid after **0.46 queries**. D14 originally claimed it "would not
  finish"; measured, it finishes — the decision was right, the stated reason overshot.
- **Dense brute-force search is 5.8× faster per query than the sparse index.** Sparse
  means less arithmetic, not less time: BLAS gets 100 MB of sequential work, CSR does
  scattered gathers.
- **Batching is a memory necessity, not a speed-up.** 620 q/s at batch 1, 1,269 at batch
  32, and **727 at batch 256** — it regresses once the score block leaves cache. What it
  actually buys is avoiding a 9.9 GB score matrix on 7.7 GB of RAM.

**The anti-gaming result (Q9)** — identical algorithm, counting window moved from training
to the evaluated window:

| arm | MIND | EB-NeRD |
|---|---|---|
| popularity (train) · honest | 0.5423 | 0.4647 |
| popularity (**future**) · leaking | **0.6102** | **0.6657** |
| semantic · honest, our best system | 0.6338 | 0.5331 |

On EB-NeRD, moving one counting window is worth **+0.2010 AUC** while semantic beats random
by only 0.0344 — **one leaked feature outvalues roughly 4× all the honest modelling in this
project.** That is the argument for why leaderboard rank is a poor grading signal, in a
single number.

## Three findings that shaped the design

1. **Content-based retrieval is blind to time, structurally.** BM25's top-200 reproduces
   the corpus's own freshness profile (16.6% fresh) while **92.7% of actual clicks are
   fresh**. Running a completely different matching function reproduced it exactly
   (semantic: 31.9% fresh vs a 33.5% corpus baseline, against 93.5% of real EB-NeRD
   clicks) — so this is a property of content matching as such, not a BM25 flaw. Neither
   formula contains a time term, so it cannot be tuned away; it has to be handled outside
   the scoring function (D19) or not at all.

2. **Retrieval and re-ranking are different jobs.** BM25 holds a 1.21× retrieval lift on
   EB-NeRD yet **cannot re-rank it at all** (AUC 0.4966, CI [0.4917, 0.5009] — contains
   0.5). The platform's own recommender has already spent the easy signal, so everything in
   the candidate list is already plausible and lexical overlap no longer separates it.

3. **A metric measured in the space a method optimises grades it tautologically.** Semantic
   ÷ BM25 intra-list diversity is 0.544 in embedding space but **1.041 by category** on
   EB-NeRD — reported conventionally we would have published "semantic produces markedly
   less diverse lists", which is false in *direction*. The same shape appeared again in
   popularity scoring AUC 0.9737 on a slice defined by popularity. Two instances made it a
   rule rather than an anecdote.

## Environment

WSL2 · 7.7 GB RAM · **no GPU** · Python 3.12 · Polars 1.43 · CPU-only PyTorch 2.13.
Everything above runs on that machine; nothing requires cloud compute (D29).
