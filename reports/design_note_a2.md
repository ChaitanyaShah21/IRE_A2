## 1. What was built, and the one idea behind it

A1 ended on a measured gap rather than a result: **BM25 and embedding retrieval contain no
time term** — a structural fact about the two formulas, not a tuning failure — while
**92.7% (MIND) / 93.5% (EB-NeRD) of real clicks are on fresh articles**. Three independent
routes reached that conclusion, the sharpest being that train-window popularity predicts
EB-NeRD clicks in the *wrong* direction (AUC 0.4647), because 86.9% of validation
candidates were never clicked during training at all.

A2 acts on it. The A1 scorers are not replaced; **they become features** of a trained
re-ranker that also sees time:

```
 A1, unchanged                          A2, new
 BM25 index ┐                    ┌ features/ : recency-decayed history (3 half-lives),
 embeddings ├── scores as ──────►│             category affinity, freshness, windowed
 availability filter             │             exposure share, session context
            │                    └────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────
            └── top-K (K=100) ──────────────────────► rank/gbdt.py  LambdaRank (LightGBM)
                                                      rank/nrms.py  NRMS baseline (Q3)
                                                                    │
                                        metrics · slices · paired bootstrap (A1's, extended)
```

Because `cos_inf` (infinite half-life) reproduces A1's semantic score exactly and `bm25`
is A1's lexical score, **"before re-ranking" is one column of "after"** — the Q2
comparison is two orderings of the same candidate list, not two unrelated systems.

**Two candidate sets, deliberately kept apart (D37).** Both leaderboards ask us to
re-rank a *supplied* list (`article_ids_inview` / `impressions`); Q2 also asks us to
*retrieve* top-K from the whole corpus. These are different operations on different
candidate sets, and conflating them is the easiest way to report a meaningless number.
Every table below says which it is.

## 2. Q1 — features, and the boundary that makes them honest

| Feature | MIND | EB-NeRD |
|---|---|---|
| `cos_short / cos_medium / cos_inf` — decayed user profile · candidate (D35) | ✓ (3/10/∞ positions) | ✓ (1 d / 7 d / ∞) |
| `cat_share_short / medium / inf` — recency-weighted category affinity | ✓ | ✓ |
| `bm25` — A1's lexical score, N=100 (D31) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `freshness_hours` — T − min(published_time, first_seen) (D34c) | ✓ (first_seen only) | ✓ |
| `exposure_share_1h / _24h` — label-free share, strictly before T (D34b) | ✓ | ✓ |
| `hours_since_last_click` (D35) | — | ✓ |
| `session_position`, `minutes_since_session_start`, `device_type` (D34a) | — | ✓ |

**The feature set is an allowlist, never a denylist**, and the builder *asserts* its output
columns equal keys + label + that list. This is not tidiness: `total_pageviews` and
`total_inviews` already sit in our `articles.parquet` and are whole-dataset aggregates
containing the future, so any builder that loops over article columns picks them up and
nothing errors.

**Boundary enforcement (Q1.4, Q9.2).** `tests/test_no_leakage.py` asserts two *properties*
on real validation data for both datasets, rather than a list of per-feature checks:
*future deletion* (delete every impression after τ; features at or before τ must be
byte-identical) and *label blindness* (shuffle the clicks; every feature must be
identical). A new feature is covered automatically. The suite is mutation-verified: four
realistic forward leaks were planted in production code and **all four were caught** —
but only after extending the check to MIND, because on EB-NeRD `published_time` almost
always wins the `min`, so the `first_seen` path is never exercised there.

**Three landmines the data set for us, each measured rather than assumed.** EB-NeRD's
article catalogue runs to 2023-07-11, a month past the test week (2,148 articles are
published after the train week ends), so **no catalogue-wide statistic is ever a
feature**. EB-NeRD's `session_id` is shared by more than one user (1,032 ids), so sessions
are keyed **(user, session)**: keyed by id alone the longest "session" is 14 days, keyed
properly it is 29 minutes. And 1,810 candidate rows (11 articles) are shown *before* their
`published_time`, which is why freshness takes the earliest evidence of existence.

## 3. Q2 — the trained re-ranker, before and after

**Model (D36).** LightGBM with the `lambdarank` objective: it is scored only on ordering
each impression's clicked candidates above its unclicked ones, weighted by how much a swap
would move nDCG. Trained on the train split, tree count chosen by validation nDCG@10,
**every number below from the local test split**, which chose nothing. Hyperparameters were
fixed before any result was seen. LightGBM learns impression boundaries from group *sizes*
alone, so a shuffle trains happily and ranks garbage; `group_sizes` derives them from the
ids and refuses non-contiguous input.

### 3.1 Supplied inview lists — what the leaderboards grade

| System | MIND AUC | MIND nDCG@10 | EB-NeRD AUC | EB-NeRD nDCG@10 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| random | 0.4982 | 0.2756 | 0.5007 | 0.4288 |
| bm25 (A1) | 0.5641 | 0.3265 | 0.5041 | 0.4305 |
| semantic (A1) — *before* | 0.6097 | 0.3588 | 0.5457 | 0.4585 |
| **LambdaRank (A2)** — *after* | **0.6144** | **0.3636** | **0.7428** | **0.6250** |
| paired gain over *before* | +0.0048 **[0.0012, 0.0080]** | +0.0048 | +0.1971 **[0.1953, 0.1989]** | +0.1665 |

Both AUC gains exclude zero. **The asymmetry is the finding, not a disappointment.**
Feature importances say why: on EB-NeRD, freshness (38%) and exposure share (21% + 13%)
carry 73% of the model's gain; on MIND, `cos_inf` leads at 27% and freshness at 20%, and
the model saturates after 18 trees — validation nDCG@10 is flat from ~20 to 300 trees
while training nDCG@10 climbs 0.396 → 0.457. Single-feature AUCs on MIND put freshness at
0.534 and exposure at 0.533 against similarity's 0.610. **MIND ships no publication times
and no history timestamps**, so its freshness must be inferred from first appearance in a
sampled log, and its recency can only use list position. The time signal helps where the
data records time and cannot help where it does not; that is a property of the datasets
that the design had to absorb, and it is why the two datasets' decay features are not
comparable to each other.

### 3.2 Retrieved top-K (K = 100) — our own candidate generation

| | MIND | EB-NeRD |
|---|---|---|
| recall@100, in-circulation pool | 2.6% | 2.5% |
| impressions with ≥1 click retrieved | 798 of 21,289 | 4,704 of 186,721 |
| MRR, retrieval order → re-ranked | 0.070 → **0.260** | 0.052 → **0.567** |
| AUC, retrieval order → re-ranked | 0.567 → 0.786 | 0.508 → 0.968 |

Two honest readings. First, **recall@K is the ceiling**: re-ranking cannot rescue the
97.5% of impressions whose clicked article never entered the top 100, which is why both
leaderboards score a supplied list instead. Second, **EB-NeRD's 0.968 is not a better
system than §3.1's 0.743**: the 99 negatives here were drawn from a 125,541-article corpus
by text similarity, so most were not in circulation that day, and freshness separates them
almost trivially. Easy negatives inflate AUC. The supplied-list number is the one to
believe.

## 4. Q3 — baseline reproduced, then beaten

**Baseline (D39): NRMS** (Wu et al., 2019) — multi-head self-attention over the user's
clicked articles, then additive attention to pool them, scored by dot product against the
candidate, trained with one click against four same-impression negatives. **One documented
deviation:** the news encoder is a learned projection of our existing 384-dim multilingual
sentence embeddings instead of word-level attention over title tokens. That is what makes
it trainable on a GPU-less laptop; the user encoder, objective and scoring are the paper's.

**The one principled change (D40): a time term.** NRMS has no time input at all. A small
MLP over (log freshness, exposure share 1 h, exposure share 24 h) is added to the click
score, zero-initialised so training *starts* at exactly the baseline. The change was
chosen from A1's measurements **before** any NRMS result existed — A1's Finding 5 is that
selecting a claim after seeing its result is a tautology in disguise.

<!-- TBD: NRMS ablation table (4 arms, paired CI) from reports/nrms_ablation_*_test.csv -->

## 5. Q4 — serving: memory, p99, and cost per 1,000 queries

Measured per **single user request** (K = 100), single process, **with nothing else running**
— NRMS training was suspended for the measurement, because A1's error log already contains
a conclusion that had to be withdrawn after being taken on a contended machine.

| | MIND | EB-NeRD |
|---|---|---|
| resident footprint, total | **283 MB** | **475 MB** |
| — largest items | embeddings 100 MB · user vectors 77 MB · exposure index 71 MB · BM25 19 MB | embeddings 193 MB · exposure index 123 MB · user vectors 61 MB · session table 44 MB |
| start-up (context build) | 5.2 s | 137 s at leaderboard scale |
| stage 1, retrieve top-100 | p50 **9.0 ms**, p99 23.7 ms | p50 **9.6 ms**, p99 22.2 ms |
| stage 2, build features | p50 **223.0 ms**, p99 348.0 ms | p50 **439.0 ms**, p99 2,352 ms |
| stage 3, score 100 candidates | p50 **3.2 ms**, p99 9.0 ms | p50 **4.3 ms**, p99 6.9 ms |
| **total** | p50 237 ms, **p99 360 ms** | p50 452 ms, **p99 2,369 ms** |
| throughput per core | 4.2 q/s | 1.5 q/s |
| **cost per 1,000 queries** (at $0.04 / vCPU-hour) | **$0.0027** | **$0.0077** |
| cores for 1,000 QPS | 239 | 689 |
| **p99 < 100 ms SLA** | **not met** | **not met** |

**Little's law as a consistency check.** With one request in flight, X ≤ 1/R: MIND's
R = 0.237 s gives X ≤ 4.2 q/s, which is exactly the measured per-core throughput. The
model is therefore internally consistent, and the only way past 4.2 q/s per core is to cut
R or add concurrency.

**We fail the SLA, and the reason is architectural rather than algorithmic.** Stage 1
(9 ms) and stage 3 (3–4 ms) are comfortably inside budget. **Feature assembly is 93–97% of
the request**, and the honest diagnosis is that we are calling a *batch* builder once per
request:

- Only **13.5% (MIND) / 16.8% (EB-NeRD)** of that stage is per-user profile work — three
  decayed profiles, three category-share tables, the BM25 query — measured separately. So
  "precompute user profiles nightly" is necessary but **not** sufficient; it buys ~30 ms of
  223 ms.
- The remainder is fixed per-call cost: DataFrame joins against whole-dataset tables (a
  1.2M-row session table, 125k articles, a 65k-entry category map) to answer a 100-row
  question. The same code processes **~11,500 rows/s in bulk** (2.25M rows in 195 s) and
  **~450 rows/s one request at a time** — a ~26× penalty that is all overhead.

**What it would take to meet p99 < 100 ms** (a projection from the measurements above, not
a measurement): precompute user profiles into a key-value store (−30 ms), replace the
per-request joins with array lookups keyed by article row (the join targets are all static
within an hour), and cache article-level features by (article, hour) — the same structure
§8 wants at 10×. Stages 1 and 3 already sum to ~13 ms, so a feature lookup path of ~20 ms
would put p99 near 40 ms and the cost per 1,000 queries near $0.0003. **We did not build
that**, and saying so is more useful than quoting a number we did not measure.

**Where the money actually goes at our scale.** The leaderboard run is the batch case and
it is cheap: 206M candidate rows featurised and scored in 155 min on one machine, ~22,000
rows/s, i.e. the whole 13.5M-impression test set for well under a dollar of compute. Our
system is a strong batch scorer and a weak online one, which is the correct thing to know
about it.

## 6. Q5 — extended evaluation, sliced

All seven metrics, over the supplied-inview pipeline on the local test split, with
1,000-resample percentile CIs. Slices are D26's: cold = history ≤ 5 articles; head/tail by
exposure, where an impression is head only if *every* clicked article is in the head set
(2,922 MIND / 243 EB-NeRD impressions are mixed and counted in neither, rather than
silently assigned).

| | MIND: semantic (A1) → LambdaRank | EB-NeRD: semantic (A1) → LambdaRank |
|---|---|---|
| all | 0.6097 → 0.6144, paired **+0.0048 [0.0012, 0.0080]** | 0.5457 → 0.7428, **+0.1971 [0.1953, 0.1989]** |
| cold (n = 3,904 / 680) | 0.5642 → 0.5529, **−0.0113** | 0.5538 → 0.7348, **+0.1810** |
| warm (n = 18,043 / 186,041) | 0.6195 → 0.6277, **+0.0083** | 0.5457 → 0.7428, **+0.1971** |
| head-exposure (n = 13,108 / 98,719) | 0.5955 → 0.5828, **−0.0127 [−0.0176, −0.0079]** | 0.5565 → 0.7745, **+0.2179** |
| tail-exposure (n = 5,917 / 87,759) | 0.6319 → 0.6671, **+0.0353** | 0.5334 → 0.7076, **+0.1741** |
| diversity (category, K=10) | 0.8166 → 0.7352 | 0.7993 → 0.8029 |
| novelty (bits) | 17.34 → 17.69 | 18.87 → 19.06 |
| coverage | 0.0283 → 0.0318 | 0.0260 → 0.0247 |

Three readings we would defend:

1. **On EB-NeRD the gain is not an artefact of one population** — it holds in every slice,
   largest on head-exposure (+0.218) and smallest on tail (+0.174). A model leaning on
   popularity should be expected to do *better* where articles are widely shown, and it
   does, which is a consistency check rather than a surprise.
2. **On MIND the aggregate +0.0048 hides two sign flips, which is exactly what slicing is
   for.** The model is *worse* on cold users (−0.0113) and *worse* on head-exposure
   impressions (−0.0127 [−0.0176, −0.0079]), and better on warm (+0.0083) and much better
   on tail-exposure (+0.0353). The mechanism is measurable rather than guessed: on MIND a
   candidate's own exposure share predicts clicks in the **inverse** direction within its
   own rack (AUC 0.476 taken positively, 0.524 inverted), so the model learns to
   down-weight heavily-shown articles. That helps where the clicked article is obscure and
   hurts where it is the popular one. A cold user additionally has no decayed profile at
   all, so nothing compensates. Together these argue for a cold-start fallback and for
   rack-relative rather than absolute popularity features — the improvement we would make
   next, and the one §4's GBDT property predicts.
3. **The re-ranker is not free on diversity.** On MIND it trades category diversity
   (0.817 → 0.735) for novelty and coverage; on EB-NeRD it costs coverage
   (0.0260 → 0.0247) while raising novelty. Coverage is reported **without** a CI (D27):
   the bootstrap is biased downward for a union statistic, and the raw spread is carried in
   the CSV under its own column names instead.

## 7. Q9 — anti-gaming: leakage test, and the price of a serving-time feature

**The test (Q9.2).** Two properties, not a checklist: future deletion and label
blindness (§2), mutation-verified against four planted leaks. A quarantined future feature
*fails* the same check, which is how we know the check can see a leak at all.

**The ablation (Q9.1).** The shipped model is trained twice: on the allowlist, and on the
allowlist plus everything in `features/unavailable.py` (`read_time`,
`scroll_percentage`, `total_pageviews`, `future_exposure_share_24h`).

| MIND (test, 21,947) | AUC | MRR |
|---|---|---|
| honest — **this is what ships** | 0.6144 [0.6104, 0.6185] | 0.3191 |
| + serving-unavailable | 0.5994 [0.5952, 0.6033] | 0.3014 |
| paired difference | **−0.0150 [−0.0181, −0.0118]** | −0.0177 |

| EB-NeRD (test, 186,721) | AUC | MRR |
|---|---|---|
| honest — **this is what ships, and what both leaderboard files came from** | 0.7428 [0.7415, 0.7441] | 0.5219 |
| + serving-unavailable | 0.7590 [0.7578, 0.7602] | 0.5487 |
| paired difference | **+0.0162 [0.0153, 0.0172]** | +0.0269 |

**The price of cheating on EB-NeRD is +0.016 AUC: real, but under a tenth of what the
honest behavioural features bought (+0.197).** The two columns that carry it are
`total_pageviews` (17% of the leaky model's gain) and `future_exposure_share_24h` (16%).

**`read_time` and `scroll_percentage` — the two features the schema most invites you to
misuse — turn out to be inert here, and the reason is structural.** EB-NeRD records dwell
and scroll **per impression**, not per candidate, so they take the same value for every
candidate in a rack. A ranking objective only ever compares candidates *within* a rack, so
a rack-constant feature cannot change any ordering; neither reaches the leaky model's top
five. That is worth stating because it cuts against the intuition that the most obviously
post-hoc field is the most dangerous one: **the dangerous leak is the one that varies per
candidate**, which is why `total_pageviews` (a per-article whole-dataset aggregate) is the
biggest offender in this table.

**Cheating made MIND worse, and the reason is mechanical, not moral.** MIND ships no dwell
or pageview fields, so the only quarantined column with data is the forward exposure
window — and MIND's log ends 2019-11-15 23:58, so that window is 37–138 h wide in training
but only 5.7–11.4 h at test time, inflating the feature's mean 3.2× (0.075 → 0.241). The
leaky model leaned on it (118 trees against 18; 15.7% of its gain) and was then handed a
differently-distributed input. **So MIND cannot price the leak**; EB-NeRD, where all four
columns exist and three are not window-dependent, is where that price is measurable.

## 8. Where it breaks at 10×

The honest basis for this section is that we **already ran the largest thing we have**:
205,925,868 candidate rows (EB-NeRD) and 93,115,001 (MIND) were featurised and scored
locally, in **155 min** and **26 min**, at a 10.6 GB peak on an 11 GB machine. So what
follows extrapolates from a measured run rather than from an estimate.

**Three things that made the current scale run, each a lesson about the next one.**

1. *Never materialise the exploded candidate list as strings.* 206M (impression, article)
   pairs cost ~10 GB as Polars strings and 1.4 GB as one sorted `int64` key per pair;
   `searchsorted` over that array answers the popularity question in 40 ms per 59k rows.
2. *A deep slice of a lazy frame is not free once a row index is attached.* One 5,000-row
   chunk at offset 5M cost **297 s**, because the row index forces a scan of everything
   before it. Writing the prepared frame to Parquet first made it instant — the same class
   of error as assuming an operation is cheap because a *similar* one measured cheap.
3. *Partition by user, not by file order.* Per-user work (three decayed profiles, category
   shares, the BM25 query) costs ~3.4 ms and was being repeated in every chunk a user
   appeared in. Hashing users into 64 groups pays it once: 2.7 min per 215k-impression
   group.

**At 10× (135M impressions, ~2 G candidate rows), in the order things break:**

- **The exposure index, first.** 2 G `int64` keys is **16 GB** — it stops fitting. It must
  become either time-bucketed shards or a count keyed by (article, hour) instead of by
  impression, which is a bounded-size structure: 125k articles × 168 hours is 21M cells,
  not 2 G.
- **Per-user feature building, second.** It is linear and precomputed nowhere: ~8 M users ×
  3.4 ms ≈ **7.5 h** of profile building alone. A production system would move it to a
  nightly batch, because a user profile is a function of history, not of the request.
- **Wall clock, third.** ~26 h on this machine, which is past any deadline — but the work
  is embarrassingly parallel by user group, so it is a horizontal-scaling problem rather
  than an algorithmic one. Nothing in the pipeline requires a global shuffle.
- **What does *not* break:** the model (322 trees, 1.6 MB), the embeddings (190 MB), and
  BM25 (a fixed sparse matrix). Stage 1 and stage 2 both stay within a single machine's
  memory at 10×; it is the *log-derived* features that grow with traffic.

**One caveat about numbers taken under pressure.** Profiling one leaderboard chunk showed
`searchsorted` at 0.7 s per call; the same call on a quiet machine takes **10 ms**. The
difference was memory pressure, not the array. A1's error log already contains a
conclusion that had to be withdrawn for exactly this reason, which is why the latency
figures in §5 were taken with nothing else running.

## 9. Reproducing, and what is ours

`README.md` carries the one-command rebuild. `AI_USAGE.md` marks every file as
AI-generated, AI-generated-then-edited or human-written, and `reports/ai_transcripts/`
holds the prompt log (Q7.4). The Codabench worker tooling under `codabench/` is
infrastructure, not pipeline: the organisers' scoring program, hidden reference data and
metrics are used unmodified.
