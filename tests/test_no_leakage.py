"""Q9: assertions that no future information reaches a prediction.

Required explicitly by the assignment - *"Enforce the behaviour-window boundary
- no future-click leakage. Include a test asserting this."*

Leakage is the failure mode this project is least able to detect by looking at
results, because its only symptom is that the numbers get *better*. Every other
bug here announces itself with a traceback, a NaN or an implausible figure. A
leak announces itself with a good score, which is the one outcome nobody
investigates. So it has to be asserted rather than observed.

Two conditions are needed, and arguing only the first is the common mistake:

  TEMPORAL   a prediction for time T may use only facts true strictly before T.
  LABEL-FREE it may not be derived from `clicked_article_ids`, at any time.

The second is independent. A candidate pool built from "articles clicked before
T" satisfies TEMPORAL perfectly and is still leakage, because the pool has been
pre-selected by the answers. D19 requires both; these tests assert both.

The tests run against the real feature store where one exists and skip if it
does not, so a fresh clone still passes - but the constructed-data tests always
run, because they are the ones that can prove a specific wrong implementation
would be caught.
