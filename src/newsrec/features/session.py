"""Q1.2 session features, EB-NeRD only and label-free (D34a).

MIND has no session or dwell fields at all, so these exist for one dataset;
D34's consequence is that the two datasets' re-rankers see different features.

A session is keyed by (user_id, session_id), never session_id alone: measured
2026-09-18, 1,032 EB-NeRD session ids are shared by more than one user, and
grouping on the id alone merges strangers into one "session" - the longest such
merge spans 14 days. Keyed properly, the longest real session is 29 minutes.
