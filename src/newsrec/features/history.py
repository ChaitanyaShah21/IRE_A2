"""Q1.1 click-history features with multi-scale recency decay (D35).

Three scales per dataset - short, medium, infinite - become separate features
and the re-ranker learns their mix. Ages are measured from the user's *newest*
history click, not from the impression:

    weight_i = 0.5 ** ((t_newest - t_i) / half_life)

A normalised weighted average is unchanged when every weight is scaled by the
same factor, so this equals measuring from the impression time T - which
cancels. Two consequences (D35): the decayed profile is per user rather than
per impression, and it cannot underflow, because the newest click always has
weight exactly 1. Measured from T instead, a 600-hour-old click at a 1-hour
half-life weighs 0.5**600 ~ 1e-181, and a little further every weight is 0.0
and the average is 0/0.

Time away from the site is the one thing that cancellation discards, so it is
recovered as its own per-impression feature, `hours_since_last_click` - which
is also where the no-future-click guard lives.

Age is time on EB-NeRD (hours) and list position on MIND, whose history
timestamps are 100% null. The two are NOT comparable across datasets.
