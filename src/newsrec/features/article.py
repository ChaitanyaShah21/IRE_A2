Both are computed per (impression, candidate) row, from facts strictly before
the impression - and neither reads a click label, so both can be computed on the
Codabench testset exactly as on train/val.

Popularity is a SHARE, never a count: the feature store is a 5% user sample and
the leaderboard is the full population, so a raw count would be ~20x larger at
submission time than at training time (D34b).
