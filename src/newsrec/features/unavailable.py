"""Q9's quarantine: features that are NOT available at serving time.

Never imported by the production feature set (asserted in
tests/test_feature_table.py). Each is used only as an ablation arm, to price
what a serving-unavailable feature would appear to buy.

  read_time, scroll_percentage  measured AFTER the impression is served, even
                                though EB-NeRD's testset still carries them -
                                present is not available (CLAUDE.md §6).
  total_pageviews               a whole-dataset aggregate, i.e. includes the
                                future of every impression.
  future_exposure_share_24h     the mirror of D34b's feature over (T, T+24h]:
                                what the site WILL push, which it cannot know.
