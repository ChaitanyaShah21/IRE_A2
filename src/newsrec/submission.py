"""Phase 5 / Q5 - read the unlabeled leaderboard test bundles.

This module is deliberately separate from `build.py` (which builds the
train/val/test feature store) for one reason worth stating plainly: the word
"test" already means something else here. D7's local test split is carved from
MINDsmall_dev's / EB-NeRD-validation's tail and *has labels*. The bundles read
here are the Codabench test sets - millions of impressions with no labels at
all. Folding them into `impressions.parquet` under `split == "test"` would
silently redefine that split for every script written in Phases 1-4.

So: same unified schema (D3), same reader functions where they already work,
but a separate output directory `data/processed/submission/`.

Landmines this module exists to handle, all three verified against the real
bundles on 2026-08-25 before a line of this was written:

  1. EB-NeRD's test behaviors has **no `article_ids_clicked` column** - 14
     columns, and the label is simply absent. `ingest_ebnerd.load_behaviors`
     selects it unconditionally and raises ColumnNotFoundError.
  2. MIND's test behaviors has **no `-0`/`-1` click suffixes** - verified 0
     matches for `N[0-9]+-[01]` across 50,000 rows. `ingest_mind.load_behaviors`
     degrades *correctly but silently* here (the suffix strip becomes a no-op
     and the clicked filter yields empty lists, which is what D3 specifies for
     unlabeled rows). Silent-and-correct today is silent-and-wrong the day the
     format changes, so `assert_unlabeled` checks it instead of trusting it.
  3. EB-NeRD's test behaviors carries an **`is_beyond_accuracy` flag**, true for
     exactly 200,000 of 13,536,710 rows (counted). Carried through rather than
     dropped so the submission writer can see it. What that flag *means* to the
     scorer is **not** verified - the published Submission Guidelines never
     mention it - so we predict every row, which the official example submission
     confirms is correct: it contains all 13,536,710 lines.
