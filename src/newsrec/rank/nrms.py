"""Q3 baseline: NRMS (Wu et al., 2019), on CPU, over frozen article embeddings.

WHAT NRMS IS
Two encoders and a dot product.
  news encoder: article -> vector.
  user encoder: the vectors of the user's clicked articles -> one user vector,
                via multi-head SELF-attention (each clicked article looks at
                the others, so "football" next to "transfer news" is read
                differently from "football" next to "injury report"), then
                ADDITIVE attention (a learned weighted average - some clicks
                count more than others).
  click score:  user . candidate.
Training: for every click, sample `NEG` unclicked candidates from the SAME
impression and apply softmax cross-entropy over the 1 + NEG scores ("which of
these five did they click?") - the paper's negative-sampling objective.

THE ONE DEVIATION FROM THE PAPER (D39)
The paper's news encoder learns word-level self-attention over title tokens
from GloVe vectors. Ours is a learned projection of the 384-dim multilingual
sentence embedding we already have for every article (D20): the word-level half
is replaced by a pretrained sentence encoder. The user encoder, the objective
and the scoring are the paper's. This is what makes it trainable on a CPU in
minutes, and it is stated as a deviation, not hidden.

THE Q3 IMPROVEMENT HOOK
`time_features`: optional per-candidate columns (freshness, exposure share)
added to the click score through a small learned term. NRMS, like A1's
retrievers, has no time input at all; A1 measured that 92.7-93.5% of clicks go
to fresh articles. Off = the reproduced baseline; on = the improvement.

    """The paper's news encoder, restored (D43): GloVe words -> self-attention
    -> additive attention -> one news vector.

    Takes a tensor of token ids with ANY leading shape - (B, L) for a batch of
    titles, (B, L, C) for a user's history or an impression's candidates - and
    returns the same leading shape with the last axis replaced by DIM. That is
    what lets it drop straight into the existing model: `self.news` was already
    called on a gathered (..., emb_dim) float tensor, and is now called on a
    gathered (..., TITLE_LEN) integer one, with nothing else changed.

    Why `padding_idx=0` matters twice. It freezes the <pad> row's gradient at
    zero, so the padding vector cannot drift away from zero during training -
    and the attention mask below independently refuses to attend to it. Either
    alone would do; both together mean a bug in one is not silent.

    The empty-title trap is the same one the user encoder already has for
    users with no history: attention over an all-masked sequence is a softmax
    over all -1e9, which is NaN, and a NaN propagates through the whole batch's
    loss rather than affecting one row. MIND has no empty titles today - 0 of
    65,238, measured - which is exactly why this needs a guard rather than a
    comment, since the day one appears nothing would point here.

    A CAVEAT THAT AFFECTS EVERY REPORTED NRMS NUMBER (found 2026-09-20)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    This function was written to own its whole epoch loop, so it seeds the RNG
    and builds the optimiser once per CALL. `run_nrms.py` then has to drive it
    one epoch at a time, because epoch selection needs a validation score after
    each epoch - and with the defaults that means, per epoch:

      * `rng` is reseeded to SEED, so `training_samples` redraws the SAME
        negatives in the SAME order every epoch, despite its docstring
        promising they are "re-drawn every epoch"; and
      * a fresh Adam is built, discarding momentum and variance estimates.

    Every D41 arm ran this identical procedure, so the ablation comparisons and
    paired CIs are unaffected - the arms differ only in their time inputs. What
    it depresses is the ABSOLUTE level, and it partly explains the recorded
    "validation still rising at epoch 3": the optimiser restarts each epoch.

    The defaults are left as they were, deliberately. D43's word-level run is a
    comparison against D41's sentence-level numbers, and changing the training
    procedure would confound the architecture with the optimisation. To train
    properly instead, build the optimiser once and pass `epoch_offset=ep`:

        opt = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)
        for ep in range(epochs):
            train(model, b, emb, epochs=1, optimizer=opt, epoch_offset=ep)

    Doing that for real means re-running every arm, which is why it is recorded
    here as a known deviation rather than silently corrected.
