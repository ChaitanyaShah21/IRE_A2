"""Q2: the trained re-ranker - LightGBM with the `lambdarank` objective.

WHAT IS BEING TRAINED
One model per dataset. Input: the Q1 feature table, one row per
(impression, candidate). Output: one score per row. Only the ORDER of scores
within an impression matters; a score is never compared across impressions.

WHY LAMBDARANK, NOT A CLICK CLASSIFIER
A classifier (`binary` objective) is rewarded for getting every row's click
probability right in absolute terms, including across impressions. LambdaRank is
rewarded only for ordering each impression's clicked candidates above its
unclicked ones, with swaps near the top of the list weighted by how much they
would move nDCG. That is the thing both leaderboards grade.

LANDMINE 4 - GROUPS MUST BE CONTIGUOUS
LightGBM is told the impression structure only as a list of group SIZES
("the first 37 rows are one impression, the next 12 are the next, ..."). It
never sees impression ids. If rows of one impression are not adjacent - after a
shuffle, a join, a sort by article - the sizes still sum to the row count, so
training runs happily and learns to rank garbage. `group_sizes` therefore
checks contiguity from the ids themselves and raises, rather than trusting the
caller.
